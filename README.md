# CS-350

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to prototype a thermostat. In doing so it had to read from a temperature sensor, check that temperature against a setpoint, and turn on or off the heat (an led) depending on the outcome of that check.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did particularly well in writing code that handled that situation while staying efficient.

# Where could you improve?
I think I could improve in my understanding of the language and functions available to me within the templates. I had to constantly go back and check the includes of the code to make sure I was using it correctly.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I'm constantly learning and keeping an open mind. I never think I'm done learning and in doing so I always look for something new I can learn. As for my tools and resources, readmes and comments are invaluable.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think the skills that will transfer from this project to other projects is the ability to read the included code and understand it. Before this project I didn't look much at the includes of other projects since they weren't used much. But in understanding that those includes have tools I can access from this project I will definitely be utilizing that information.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project is maintainable, readable, and adaptable in that everything was commented, and most work is done within functions. This makes it easy to go back and change something or adapt it to slightly change the outcome.
